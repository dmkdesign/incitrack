	<div class="pointLabel">About Gridbid</div>
	<p>Gridbid.com is a startup offering a solar sales platform that reduces the cost of acquiring solar customers by 80%. Gridbid was launched in 2012 and within its first 12 months online, auctioned over $45M in roof space for solar (over 1000 roofs).
 
We are seeking an entrepreneur to join the founding team as Chief Marketing Officer. The CMO will be officially considered a co-founder and can be based anywhere in North America, with a preference for San Francisco or New York City.

The CMO will join Tom Kineshanko, Chris Hunter and Marc Baumgartner to build Gridbid into a profitable business that solves one of the biggest problems in solar-customer acquisition. Tom (product), Chris (sales), and Marc (design) are seasoned founders with a track record of successful execution, raising angel and venture capital, and two exits.
