	How Gridbid works

	<div class="row clear-fix">
	<div class="pointLabel">1. Find Roofs Near You</div>
	<div style="float:left; margin-right:15px"><img src="images/how_gridbid_works5.png" alt="how_gridbid_works1.png"></img></div>
	
	<p >Simply enter in the locations you are looking for roofs in and any system size or finance types you are interested in! Gridbid will then present you all roofs meeting your requirements and allow you to filter and search through them based on your specific criteria.  When you find a roof you are interested in, just click the roof profile to access all information about the roof.</p>

	<div style="float:left; margin-right:15px"><img src="images/how_gridbid_works6.png" alt="how_gridbid_works2.png"></img></div>
	<p>Once you have found a roof you would like to bid on, simply click the 'Bid Now' button.  Next, you create your Gridbid account and fill out your bid in three easy steps! The form is simple & fast and allows you to easily differentiate yourself from your competitors.</p>

	<div style="float:left; margin-right:15px"><img src="images/how_gridbid_works7.png" alt="how_gridbid_works3.png"></img></div>
	<p>Each roof receives a maximum of 4 bids, so at most you are competing with three other installers.  Once the roof owner chooses the winning bidder, you will be notified instantly whether you won.  If you are selected as the winner, you will automatically be sent the contact information of your new exclusive lead. If not, you will see what bid did win so you can improve your chances of winning next time. </p>

	<div style="float:left; margin-right:15px"><img src="images/how_gridbid_works8.png" alt="how_gridbid_works4.png"></img></div>
	<p>Unlike competitors, Gridbid only makes you pay if you actually secure the roof.  Since bidding with Gridbid is simple & fast, you will greatly reduce your business development costs for each roof you secure.</p>
